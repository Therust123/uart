# uart
UART stands for Universal Asynchronous Reciever Transmitter.The full form itself is self explaining. It is a implementation of data transmission and reciever in which there is no synchronising clock.
In this interface we have 2 lines only , one is transmitter line and the other is reciver line . 
Since we have no synchronising clock , the sampling of data at right time is very important, for sampling here we have Baud Rate , Baud rate is nothing but a represenation of how much bits is transferred per second .For example if we write the baud rate as 9600 , then it means that 9600 bits will be transferred every second.
